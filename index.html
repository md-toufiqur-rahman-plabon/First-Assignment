          <h2>Food for a family</h2>
          <p>Parents first forgo food themselves, skipping meals to feed their children. But if there still isn't enough
            for everyone, the study found parents will feed younger children before teenagers, regularly leaving the
            older kids—teen boys in particular—without enough to eat.</p>

          <h2>Education for a child</h2>
          <p>Deprivation has many faces: the child who grows up in a home which is culturally and educationally
            unstimulating is handicapped by environmental deprivation; the child who is unloved and rejected by his
            parents suffers emotional deprivation; and the child who lives in residential care, for long periods or
            permanently, is deprived of normal family life. These three conditions are not, of course, mutually
            exclusive, and there are also other kinds of deprivation which affect education. But for the purpose of this
            chapter I shall confine myself to these three situations, not least because they are of most immediate
            relevance to those working in the residential child care field.</p>

    <h1>Let's Save Them</h1>
    <p> Around 9 million people die every year of hunger and hunger-related diseases. This is more than from AIDS,
      malaria and tuberculosis combined.
      A child dies from hunger every 10 seconds
      Poor nutrition and hunger is responsible for the death of 3.1 million children a year. That’s nearly half of all
      deaths in children under the age of 5. The children die because their bodies lack basic nutrients.

      Globally, 822 million people suffer from undernourishment.</p>
